In this way RGB images can be handled.\r\n    * Modified GetBoundingBox in order to return the actual width and height (before they were 1 pixel less). Now a 1 pixel blob has its width and height set to 1.\r\n    * Added a new function GetBlobNearestTo, to obtain the blob nearest to a user-defined point.\r\n  * 31/01/2014\r\n    * Labelling algorithm: rare threading and infinite loops issues fix.\r\n  * 16/01/2014\r\n    * Version 1.0.3\r\n    * Warning removal.\r\n    * Unreferecenced variables or classes removal.\r\n    * Fix at ExternPerimeter function, where it returned wrong values if called many times with different parameters (xBorder,yBorder and mask). Now the value is always recalculated, since the parameters can change from one call to the other.\r\n    * Fix at CBlobGetExterior and CBlobGetExternPerimeter classes, where xBorder and yBorder had different default values from the default constructor. Now they are correctly always initialised to true.\r\n  * 14/01/2013\r\n    * Version 1.0.2\r\n    * Fixed a bug with x64 systems (bad conversion from pointer to int)\r\n  * 29/12/2013\r\n    * Version 1.0.1.\r\n    * Potential stack corruption issues fix.\r\n    * Linux compilation issues fix.\r\n    * Thanks to nmaludy@gmail.com\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Building notes:\r\nThe building system moved to using Cmake! See [http://www.cmake.org/](http://www.cmake.org/)\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### To do list:\r\n  - [x] Adapt all the functions to work with joined blobs\r\n  - [x] Further enhance performance in multi-threading algorithm\r\n  - [x] Create more comparison graphs\r\n  - [ ] Add a function that counts how many pixels are in a certain range of colour in a blob\r\n  - [x] Create a CMake script\r\n  - [ ] Finish the example\r\n  - [x] Start to write tutorials and the wiki\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Stay tuned!**\r\n\r\nAll the credits for the original code go to its Author (Ricard Borras).\r\n\r\n_Saverio Murgia and Luca Nardelli_\r\n","google":"UA-40084003-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
