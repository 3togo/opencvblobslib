Now the value is always recalculated, since the parameters can change from one call to the other.\r\n    * Fix at CBlobGetExterior and CBlobGetExternPerimeter classes, where xBorder and yBorder had different default values from the default constructor. Now they are correctly always initialised to true.\r\n  * 14/01/2013\r\n    * Version 1.0.2\r\n    * Fixed a bug with x64 systems (bad conversion from pointer to int)\r\n  * 29/12/2013\r\n    * Version 1.0.1.\r\n    * Potential stack corruption issues fix.\r\n    * Linux compilation issues fix.\r\n    * Thanks to nmaludy@gmail.com\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Building notes:\r\nPay attention to the OpenCV directory: we use a system variable called OPENCV_DIR, if you do so you'll be able to compile immediately after syncing the repository, otherwise you'll have to modify that property to suit your environment.\r\n\r\nOther environment variables:\r\n\r\n  * PTHREADS_DIR: directory to the pthread library\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### To do list:\r\n  - [x] Adapt all the functions to work with joined blobs\r\n  - [x] Further enhance performance in multi-threading algorithm\r\n  - [x] Create more comparison graphs\r\n  - [ ] Add a function that counts how many pixels are in a certain range of colour in a blob\r\n  - [ ] Create a CMake script\r\n  - [ ] Finish the example\r\n  - [ ] Start to write tutorials and the wiki\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Stay tuned!**\r\n\r\nAll the credits for the original code go to its Author (Ricard Borras).\r\n\r\n_Saverio Murgia and Luca Nardelli_\r\n","google":"UA-40084003-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
